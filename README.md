How to run the project.

Grab the link from the source code.
Unzip it so it is in its normal folder form.
Open up unity and select project from disk.
Locate the "CS Project" folder that you just unpacked.
Once you have done that open the project.
Inside the project you can edit the lighting just by turning it on or off as seen in the heirarchy.
You cna move the alien around by editing the transform the details are as:

MY PC:
Alien position top:
15.06589 3.77 -12.63
Alien position bottom:
15.06589 -1.6 -12.63

Lastly if you wanted to, you could create a new material(color) and toss it onto one of the presets behind the user outside of the room.
That way you can have 3 independent variables not including whether or not the user is in VR or not like my experiment.

To conduct the experiment you start up the game by pressing the play button at the top
After, one at a time go to TEST ADMINS FOCUS HERE and select round one and in the inspector panel reveal it to the participant when they are ready
Then rinse and repeat for rounds 2 and 3

Resources Needed:
A PC that is VR ready.
Or else you can run this w/o VR
