I was by myself so there was no group and I did the work. Some struggles were as mentioned in the videos that I 
had a hard time getting participants to use the VR headset or they were unable to come and do the experiment
at my place due to them being busy with finals as well. So I called up my dad and had participants in Califoria
run the experiment while I controlled it remotely via teamviewer (super cool experience). There are some things that if given an opportunity
to work on I would improve like making it able to be done by one person and not need a second person to conduct it. This would be done by
havning OnClick() functions with the info cards and using counters and data would be stored in a CSV file. Overall had a good time with the project
and learned some things about the human's cognitive functions and perception.
